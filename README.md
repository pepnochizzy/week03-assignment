A clicker game

User Stories
🐿️ As a developer, I want to retrieve upgrade information from an API so that all the developers working on the game can access a single, consistent source of up-to-date information.
🐿️As a user, I want to be able to purchase upgrades from the shop so that I can enhance my gameplay experience.
🐿️ As a developer, I want to use functions effectively to keep my code organised and reusable.
🐿️ As a user, I’d like the website to respond dynamically so that my interactions with the website are responsive and smooth.
🐿️ As a user, I want my cookie count and relevant game information to be stored in local storage so that my progress is saved and I can continue playing from where I left off later.
🐿️ As a user, I want the cookie count to increment automatically and the game state to update each second so that the game progresses even when I’m not actively clicking.
🐿️ As a user, I want the game state to be managed every second using setInterval to ensure my progress is saved and the game remains updated.
Requirements
🎯 Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.
🎯 Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable.
🎯 Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.
